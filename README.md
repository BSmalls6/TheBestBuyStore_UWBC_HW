# TheBestBuyStore_UWBC_HW
A simple store app that displays products and allows the user to add products to a cart for checkout.  This app uses an API call to the BestBuy API, and uses react components to build the front end.

To add an item to the cart, select the amount of items you wish to add, and hit the + sign.  Then, scroll to the top of the page and click the cart icon to view your cart.  From there, you can add or remove additional numbers of the item and automatically calculate shipping and total cost.
